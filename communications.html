  <h3>Communications</h3>
  <p>Communications may be among the last physics elements which one would recall when considering aircraft, but this does not represent the real importance which communications carry in safely conducting flights.</p>
  <h4>Modes</h4>
  <p>All these communications are in the form of radio waves. They are electromagnetic waves in the same way that is visible light. Of course, it is well below the range at which we can see, starting at the bottom of the high-frequency band at 2.8 megahertz and ending up at the low gigahertz range. There are different methods whereby information that can be comprehended by humans is encoded into radio signals, then decoded back to understandable information.</p>
  <p>The first mode is amplitude modulation. Yes, it is the same type of signal as an AM radio, but it is in a much higher band. Most of these communications take place on 118-136 megahertz (MHz). The amplitude of the radio waves of a particular frequency are constantly modulated to be the same as those of the audio signal. Here is a diagram of an AM wave:</p>
              <p class="image"><a href="https://www.vedantu.com/question-sets/94ded19b-dc90-4913-9eda-fa07cbce14fa6203236461296895656.png"><img src="AM.png"></a></p>
  <p>As can be seen, the amplitude of a radio signal whose frequency is fixed (carrier wave) changes to match that of the understandable audio signal. But it turns out that this process does not just create a wave of a constant frequency, but it creates waves at many frequencies around the carrier. These are called sidebands. Each audio tone creates two; one is below the carrier, and the other is above it. Their distance from the carrier is the same as their audio frequency.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideband#Sideband_creation">[source]</a></sup> Since the carrier wave itself does not actually transmit any data and both the sidebands are identical, both the carrier and one sideband can be suppressed in high-frequency (2.8-30 MHz) communications to save power.</p>
    <p>The second mode is called phase-shift keying (PSK). As shown in the diagram below, it puts radio waves at a different point in their wave to represent digital data. Phase-shift keying is used in controller-pilot data link communications (CPDLC) and ACARS (aircraft communication, addressing, and reporting system), using eight phases to send the digital data.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_Data_Link#ICAO_VDL_Mode_2">[source]</a></sup></p>

    <h4>Media</h4>
    <p>The most common medium is VHF (very high frequency) and UHF (ultra high frequency) waves travelling in a line-of-sight pattern; that is, the signals travel in straight lines. This is satisfactory for terrestrial areas because they have enough receivers to receive these signals. Both analog and digital signals can be sent by this medium. Civilian voice communications are in the VHF range while military voice communications are in the UHF range. Also in the UHF range are radar pulses.</p>
    <p>Among the less common media is the HF (high frequency) skywave propagation. Waves from around 2.8 to 30 MHz bounce off the ionosphere, allowing for communications to travel thousands of miles.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">[source]</a></sup> The reason why this is less commonly used is that only certain frequencies will work at certain times, making it difficult to use and requiring a separate radio operator to relay messages between controllers and pilots.</p>
    <p>Satellite is not a very common medium, but it can serve as a replacement for HF radio in many oceanic or remote areas. Automatic position reports from aircraft, instructions from air traffic control, or company messages can be sent by this medium. The Iridium satellite constellation is used for many of these satellite communications, and they use PSK to encode their data.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation#Technical_details">[source]</a></sup></p>
