  <h3>Communications</h3>
  <p>Communications may be among the last physics elements which one would recall when considering aircraft, but this does not represent the real importance which communications carry in safely conducting flights.</p>
  <h4>Modes and Media</h4>
  <p>All these communications are in the form of radio waves. They are electromagnetic waves in the same way that is visible light. Of course, it is well below the range at which we can see, starting at the bottom of the high-frequency band at 2.8 megahertz and ending up at the low gigahertz range. There are different methods whereby information that can be comprehended by humans is encoded into radio signals, then decoded back to understandable information.<p>
  <p>The first mode is amplitude modulation. Yes, it is the same type of signal as an AM radio, but it is in a much higher band. Most of these communications take place on 118-136 megahertz (MHz). The amplitude of the radio waves of a particular frequency are constantly modulated to be the same as those of the audio signal.</p>
