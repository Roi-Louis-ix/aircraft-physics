      <h3>Engines</h3>
      <p>Among the most common engine types are reciprocating, turboprop, turbofan, turbojet, and scramjet. These engines have their own applications depending on efficiency and performance.</p>
      <h4>Props to the Propeller!</h4>
      <p><strong>Reciprocating (piston) engines</strong>are found in smaller aircraft, especially training ones because they are most efficient at lower speeds <sup><a href="https://airplaneacademy.com/piston-vs-turboprop-performance-efficiency-and-safety/">[source]</a></sup>. As the heading suggests, it is made from a piston engine similar to the one which can be found in an automobile. The pistons take in a mixture of fuel and air, which is compressed and combusted, turning a shaft. Here is a diagram of one:</p>
      <p class="image"><a href="https://www".comsol.com/blogs/improving-the-operational-lifetime-of-a-reciprocating-engine/"><img src="reciprocating.png"></a></p>
      <p>As can be seen in this diagram, the cylindrical piston is filled with the fuel-air mixture, compressed by the shaft's rotation, and ignited, exerting torque on the shaft.</p>
      <p><strong>Turboprop</strong> engines use turbines instead of pistons to spin their shafts. The fans in the front take in air, which in the middle is compressed, mixed with fuel, and ignited, spinning the turbines at the back of the engine. These are more efficient at higher speeds from the piston engines<sup><a href="https://airplaneacademy.com/piston-vs-turboprop-performance-efficiency-and-safety/">[source]</a></sup>, but still lower speeds from most jet aircraft. Here is a diagram of a turboprop engine:</p>
      <p class="image"><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/aturbp.html"><img src="Turboprop.gif"></a></p>
      <p>If you would like to learn more about the inner workings of a turboprop engine, the above image leads to a NASA interactive activity. Unfortunately, this is around the most "hands-on" we can get, as none of my local aviation mechanics let me play around with turbine engines.</p>
      <p>The shaft of a reciprocating engine is attached to a propeller, which acts similarly to the wing. Where a wing creates high pressure below it to generate lift, a propeller creates high pressure behind it to generate thrust<sup><a href="https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/systems/how-a-propeller-works-and-generates-thrust-as-it-spins/">[source]</a></sup>, which will accelerate the aircraft forward if it exceeds drag.</p>
        <p>Why do propellers run best at lower speeds and lower power levels from jet aircraft? This is because propellers, being comparatively larger and "fatter" to jet turbines, must spin at a lower angular speed to keep their tips from exceeding the speed of sound. Since linear speed at any point on a rotating object is the product of angular speed and radius, the angular speed must be kept lower with higher-radius objects to avoid reaching the speed of sound. Once the speed of sound is reached, the engines become inefficient as the shockwaves which they create exert wave drag on the system and very loud noises nearby residents.</p>
        <h4>Jet Engines</h4>
        <p><strong>Turbofans</strong> are not to be confused with fans of the 2013 DreamWorks movie Turbo, if any of those exist at all. They are instead a preferred type of jet engine used in many modern airliners. A fan takes in air, most of which is directed into the turbine engine, mixed with fuel, ignited, then released as thrust after passing through some turbines; some of it is directed around the engine with the fan acting somewhat as a propeller.<sup><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/Animation/turbtyp/etfr.html">[source]</a></sup> They are efficient at typical jet cruising speeds, which are around Mach 0.8. Despite this, supersonic aircraft like the F-16<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon#Propulsion">[source]</a></sup> have used turbofans. This image below will lead once again to a NASA interactive:</p>
        <p class="image"><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/aturbf.html"><img src="Turbofan.gif"></a></p>
        <p><strong>Turbojet</strong> engines are the older, noisier, and grumpier (less efficient) father of the turbofan as seen above. They do not have a fan above allowing air to pass over the engine; all the air instead goes through the turbine engine.</p>
        <p><strong>Ramjet and scramjet</strong> engines lack turbines, so they exert less wave drag on themselves than turbine engines, making them optimal for supersonic and hypersonic travel. Due to their lack of turbines, they cannot start without the assistance of another engine.<sup><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/history/pastprojects/HyperX/ramscram.html">[source]</a></sup></p>
