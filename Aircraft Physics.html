<h1><strong>The Physics of Aircraft</strong></h1>
<h4>A website by Matthew Barry that is just plane awesome.</h4>
<div class="a">
<p1>Being one of the primary methods of travel today, aircraft (and more specifically airplanes) employ many different types of physics to acheive flight. From methods of propulsion to wing shapes to airframes, physics is carefully involved and considered for all parts of flight.</p1>
<h3>Types of physics used</h3>
<p2>Since this is the feature that makes it fly, an aircraft's most obvious feature is a wing.</p2>
