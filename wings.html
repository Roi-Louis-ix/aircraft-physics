    <h4>Lift and Drag</h4>
    <p>So it turns out that wind tunnels cost significantly more than fifty cents per hour, which means that it exceeds this project's budget. But fear not; knowledge of a wing, its shape, and its function will be covered here, and it most certainly fits the budget.</p>
    <h3>Lift</h3>
    <p>The purpose of wings is to create lift, which is the aircraft's upward force, taking its journey beyond just a road trip. If lift exceeds weight (the product of mass and gravitational acceleration), the aircraft will accelerate upwards. It is modeled by this equation:</p><br>
    <p>Another force created by the wing is drag, which resists motion. It is caused by the movement of any object through a fluid. There are three types of drag, which are skin friction drag, form drag, and wave drag.
    <p><strong>Skin friction drag</strong> is the friction between the object's surface and the fluid around it, whereof the fluid is air in our situation.
      <strong>Form drag</strong> is the drag arising from the object's shape.
      <strong>Wave drag</strong> is caused by shock waves, which are formed as part of an object travels at supersonic speeds.
      <br>Drag is modeled by this equation:</br>
  <br>D=Cd*(œÅV^2)/2*A</br>
</p>
<p>Here is a free-body diagram of a wing during takeoff:<br>
<h4>Other parts of the wing</h4>
<h2>Simple enough, right? Well... there are other parts of the wing that assist the aircraft during parts of its flight.</h2>
<h3>Flaps</h3><p>During takeoff and landing extra lift is needed. This could be done simply by increasing the wing's surface area, which will increase lift as shown in its equation above. But increasing area will also increase drag as shown in the drag equation above. Therefore, a retractable method of increasing the wing's surface area when more lift is needed. Thence are flaps used.</p>
