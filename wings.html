    <p>So it turns out that wind tunnels cost significantly more than fifty cents per hour, which means that it exceeds this project's budget. But fear not; knowledge of a wing, its shape, and its function will be covered here, and it most certainly fits the budget.</p>
    <p>The purpose of wings is to create lift, which is the aircraft's upper force. If lift exceeds weight (the product of mass and gravitational acceleration), the aircraft will have a net upward force, accelerating upwards.</p>
    <p>Another force created by the wing is drag, which resists motion. It is caused by the movement of any object through a fluid. There are three types of drag, which are skin friction drag, form drag, and wave drag.</p>
    <p>Skin friction drag is the friction between the object's surface and the fluid around it, whereof the fluid is air in our situation. Since most wings are created by very smooth materials like aluminum, titanium, or composites, skin friction drag will be ignored in this section.</p>
    <p>Form drag is the drag arising from the object's shape. It is modeled by this equation:</p>
    <p>Wave drag is caused by shock waves, which are formed as part of an object travels at supersonic speeds. This affects the shape of the wings of faster aircraft.</p>
