    <p>So it turns out that wind tunnels cost significantly more than fifty cents per hour, which means that it exceeds this project's budget. But fear not; knowledge of a wing, its shape, and its function will be covered here, and it most certainly fits the budget.</p>
    <p>The purpose of wings is to create lift, which is the aircraft's upper force. If lift exceeds weight (the product of mass and gravitational acceleration), the aircraft will have a net upward force, accelerating upwards.</p>
    <p>Another force created by the wing is drag, which resists motion. It is caused by the movement of any object through a fluid. There are three types of drag, which are skin friction drag, form drag, and wave drag.
    <p><strong>Skin friction drag</strong> is the friction between the object's surface and the fluid around it, whereof the fluid is air in our situation.
      <strong>Form drag</strong> is the drag arising from the object's shape.
      <strong>Wave drag</strong> is caused by shock waves, which are formed as part of an object travels at supersonic speeds. This affects the shape of the wings of faster aircraft.
      <br>Drag is modeled by this equation:</br>
  <br>D=Cd*(œÅV^2)/2*A</br>
