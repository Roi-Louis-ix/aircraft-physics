    <h2>Lift and Drag</h2>
    <p>So it turns out that wind tunnels cost significantly more than fifty cents per hour, which means that it exceeds this project's budget. But fear not; knowledge of a wing, its shape, and its function will be covered here, and it most certainly fits the budget.</p>
    <h3>Lift</h3>
    <p>The purpose of wings is to create lift, which is the aircraft's upward force, taking its journey beyond just a road trip. If lift exceeds weight (the product of mass and gravitational acceleration), the aircraft will accelerate upwards. It is modeled by this equation:</p><br>
    <p>Wings create lift by deflecting air downwards. Here is a diagram of the airflow around a wing:</p><p><img src=""></p>
    <h3>Drag</h3>
    <p>Another force created by the wing is drag, which resists motion. It is caused by the movement of any object through a fluid. There are three types of drag, which are skin friction drag, form drag, and wave drag.
    <p><strong>Skin friction drag</strong> is the friction between the object's surface and the fluid around it, whereof the fluid is air in our situation.
      <strong>Form drag</strong> is the drag arising from the object's shape.
      <strong>Wave drag</strong> is caused by shock waves, which are formed as part of an object travels at supersonic speeds.
      <br>Drag is modeled by this equation:</br>
  <br>D=Cd*(œÅV^2)/2*A</br>
</p>
<p>Here is a free-body diagram of a wing during takeoff:<br>
<h2>Other parts of the wing</h2>
<h4>Simple enough, right? Well... there are other parts of the wing that assist the aircraft during parts of its flight.</h4>
<h3>Flaps</h3><p>During takeoff and landing extra lift is needed at comparatively lower speeds from the cruise section. This could be done simply by increasing the wing's surface area, which will increase lift as shown in its equation above. But increasing area will also increase drag as shown in the drag equation above. There is thus a need for a retractable method to increase the wing's surface area when more lift is needed, whence flaps are thence used. Here is a departing 747 with its flaps deployed:</p><p><a href="https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/10604359"><img src="747-Flaps.webp"></a><br>It can be seen that these flaps both increase the wings' surface areas and help deflect air downwards. Here is a diagram of the airflow around a wing whose flaps are deployed:</br></p>

<h3>Spoilers</h3><p>Often, an aircraft will need to hasten its descent whether it be from an air traffic control request or a flight finding itself too high. They work by deflecting upward (spoiling) the airflow around the wing, which lowers the force of lift generated by the wings. This allows flights to hasten descent without necessarily slowing down.<sup><a href=https://www.highskyflying.com/how-airplane-spoilers-work-spoilers-ground-spoilers-speed-brakes">[source]</a></sup></p>
  <h3>Speedbrakes</h3><p>There are also instances when flights will need to slow their airspeed. This can be to separate from other traffic or to accomade the 250-knot speed limit below 10,000 feet above mean sea level.<sup><a href="https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/regulations/why-there-is-a-250-knot-speed-limit-below-10000-feet-msl/">[source]</a></sup> For an aircraft to decelerate, the force of drag must be greater than the force of thrust. Reducing engine power is a way to more gradually decrease the force of thrust, but it is not the quickest method. Using flaps creates drag, but it also creates lift, which will slow or even stop a flight's descent. Using spoilers also creates drag, but it will greatly hasten descent.</p>
  <p>Speedbrakes reduce speed by creating drag while still allowing air to pass through and around them, which means that they do not inhibit the creation of lift as do the spoilers. Here is an aircraft with its speedbrakes extended:</p>
  <p><a href="https://preciseflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/KT4020-1-600x399.jpg"><img src="PA28_Speedbrakes.jpg"></a><br>It can be seen that these allow air to pass through and create lift while they create drag.</p>
