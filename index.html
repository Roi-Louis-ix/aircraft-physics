  <p1>Being one of the primary methods of travel today, aircraft (and more specifically airplanes) employ many different types of physics to acheive flight. From methods of propulsion to wing shapes to airframes, physics is carefully involved and considered for all parts of flight.</p1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <li>Wings help generate the force of lift, elevating the aircraft beyond just a funny-looking car. This will cover the different components of the wing and why different wing shapes are used in their respective situations.</li>
  <li>Since they generate lift as well, airframes will be examined. Whether the frame be for aerobatics, stealth, speed, training, or ease of use, careful decisions must be made in their production.</li>
  <li>Common propulsion methods include reciprocating, turboprop, turbofan, turbojet, scramjet, and others. Their applications and inner workings will be examined.</li>
  <li>Communications between ground stations and other aircraft are sent by radio waves encoded in both analog and digital modes. These modes and their usages will be examined.</li>
