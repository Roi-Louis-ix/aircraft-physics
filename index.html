<h1><strong>The Physics of Aircraft</strong></h1>
<h4>A website by Matthew that is just plane awesome.</h4>
<div>
  <p1>Being one of the primary methods of travel today, aircraft (and more specifically airplanes) employ many different types of physics to acheive flight. From methods of propulsion to wing shapes to airframes, physics is carefully involved and considered for all parts of flight.</p1>
  <h2>Which parts do my website cover?</h2>
  <li>Wings help generate the force of lift, elevating the aircraft beyond just a funny-looking car. This will cover why different wing shapes are used in their respective situations.</li>
  <li>Since they generate lift as well, airframes will also be examined.</li>
  <li>Common propulsion methods include reciprocating, turboprop, turbofan, turbojet, scramjet, and others. The applications of these types will be examined.</li>
