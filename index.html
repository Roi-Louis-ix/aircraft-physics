<h1><strong>The Physics of Aircraft</strong></h1>
<h4>A website by Matthew that is just plane awesome.</h4>
<div class="a">
  <li>Being one of the primary methods of travel today, aircraft (and more specifically airplanes) employ many different types of physics to acheive flight. From methods of propulsion to wing shapes to airframes, physics is carefully involved and considered for all parts of flight.</li>
  <li>Which parts do my website cover?</li>
  <li>Wings are the primary lift generators, taking the aircraft beyond a funny-looking car. This will cover why different wing shapes are used in their respective situations.</li>
  <li>Since they generate lift as well, airframes will also be examined.</li>
  <li>Jets and propellers (and the various sub-categories within them) are commonly used as propulsion methods. The advantages of each one will be examined and considered.</li>
